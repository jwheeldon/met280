1.1 About this program<br><br>

This program is designed to retrieve data from a given database within the Biodiversity server and to perform a correlation analysis, returning the sum and varance of each variable as well as the covariance and correlation coefficient of both.<br><br>

1.2 How to use this program<br><br>

Begin by navigating to home.html found in this index and follow the hyperlink to assignment 3. The user will then be prompted to input a database into the form (For command-line users, the user will be prompted to input their desired database giving 'Correlation' as a default database) and will be redirected upon submission to an output page detailing calculated values. If no input is given, the 'Correlation' database will be used by default.<br><br>

1.3 How to modify this program<br><br>

Should the user wish to connect to alternative server, the CGI program (Assignment3.pl) may be edited at line 27 which sets variables for server connections - $server may be changed from 'localhost' to a desired server. Note that $user and $password must also be changed accordingly.<br><br>
