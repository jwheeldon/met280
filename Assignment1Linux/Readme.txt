1.1 How to use this program

This Perl programme is designed to perform within the Linux operating system a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between a pair of data, measuring the extent to which two statistical variables vary.

Begin by starting Terminal (Linux) and launch Assignment1.pl in the file directory. The user will be prompted to input the name of the data file (.dat) to be read, in which the program will perform the analysis.


1.2 How to modify this program

Note that this programme is only designed to read two variables maximum within a data set (distinguished by ','). Please refer to Datafile.dat as an example data set.
